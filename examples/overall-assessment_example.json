    "overall-score": "Quality Score: 78/100\n\nThe overall data quality is at an acceptable level, but several areas require immediate attention to reach optimal standards.",
    "overall-assessment": "The current state of data quality shows mixed results across different dimensions. While completeness metrics are strong (92%), accuracy issues in customer records (15% error rate) and consistency problems between systems present significant challenges.\n\nKey strengths:\n- High data completeness in core tables\n- Good timeliness of data updates\n- Strong data governance framework in place\n\nKey weaknesses:\n- Inconsistent data formats across systems\n- Missing validation rules in several data entry points\n- Lack of automated quality checks",
    "overall-findings": "1. Customer address data contains 15% inaccuracies\n2. Product master data shows 8% duplicates\n3. Transaction timestamps are inconsistent across 3 systems\n4. Missing mandatory fields in 5% of order records\n5. Data lineage documentation is incomplete\n6. No automated data quality monitoring in place\n7. User training on data entry standards needed"
